# Section Markdown Page

You can use a `.md` file as a regular Jupyter Book page.

## Why This Matters

- Not every page needs executable cells.
- Markdown pages are lightweight and fast to maintain.
- Great for overview pages, guides, FAQ, and release notes.

## MyST Features Demo

MyST Markdown adds several website-aware enhancements beyond plain markdown.
Use these features in `.md` pages and they will render on the Jupyter Book website.

### Admonitions

::: note
MyST admonitions are a great way to add callouts, tips, warnings, and notes.
:::

::: warning
This warning block is usually visible on the built site but may not appear correctly in simple markdown previews.
:::

### Cross references

You can reference sections, figures, and pages directly from the site.

See [the MyST docs](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/) for examples.

### Task lists

- [x] Task one
- [ ] Task two
- [ ] Task three

### Definition list

Term
:  Definition text that explains the term.

### Inline math

Set notation example: $S = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : x^2 > 0\}$

### Code block with syntax highlighting

```python
print('MyST pages can still show code, and code blocks render on the website.')
```

## Visibility Note

> Some MyST-specific features may not render exactly in a plain markdown preview.
> They are designed for the Jupyter Book website and will look correct after site build.
